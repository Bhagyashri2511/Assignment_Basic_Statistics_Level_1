## Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
ANS- Three coins are tossed,
Total number of Sample possible combinations = 23 = 8
Sample= {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT}
Number of combinations that have two heads and one tail = 3, (HHT, HTH, TTH)
The probability of two heads and one tail when three coins are tossed simultaneously are
P (Two heads and One tail) = Two heads and One tail /Number of desired outcomes
= ⅜ or 0.375

## Q4)  Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a)	Equal to 1
b)	Less than or equal to 4
c)	Sum is divisible by 2 and  3
ANS- for Two Dice total number of outcome -36
a) Equal to 1: There is only one way to get a sum of 1: (1, 1). 
a) Probability = (Equal to 1) / (Total Number of Outcomes) = 1 / 36
b) Less than or equal to 4: 
   The possible combinations for sums less than or equal to 4 are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1).
   Probability = (Less than or equal to 4) / (Total Number of Outcomes) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6
c) P (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3) = N (Event (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3)) / N(Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.16 = 16.66%

## Q5)  A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
ANS- Total number of balls = (2 + 3 + 2) = 7
Let S be the sample space.
Then, n(S) = Number of drawing 2 balls out of 7
=7C2 = (2×1)(7×6) =21
Let E = drawing 2 balls, none of which is blue.
∴n(E)= Number of drawing 2 balls out of (2 + 3) balls. =5C2 = (2×1)(5×4) =10
P(E)=n(S)n(E)=2110

## Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
### Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
### CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
ANS = Expected Value = Σ (Value * Probability)
Expected Value = (1 * 0.015) + (4 * 0.20) + (3 * 0.65) + (5 * 0.005) + (6 * 0.01) + (2 * 0.120) 
                         = 0.015 + 0.80 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24
                         = 3.10

## Q7) Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range & comment about the values / draw inferences, for the given dataset
### For Points, Score, Weight
###Find Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range and also Comment about the values/ Draw some inferences. 
Use Q7.csv file 
ANS 
Mean for Points = 3.59, Score = 3.21 and Weigh = 17.84
Median for Points = 3.69, Score = 3.32 and Weigh = 17.71
Mode for Points = 3.07, Score = 3.44 and Weigh = 17.02
Variance for Points = 0.28, Score = 0.95, Weigh = 3.19
Standard Deviation for Points = 0.53, Score = 0.97, Weigh = 1.78
Range [Min-Max] for Points [3.59 – 4.93], Score [3.21 – 5.42] and Weigh [17.84 – 22.9]
