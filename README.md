## Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
ANS- Three coins are tossed,
Total number of Sample possible combinations = 23 = 8
Sample= {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT}
Number of combinations that have two heads and one tail = 3, (HHT, HTH, TTH)
The probability of two heads and one tail when three coins are tossed simultaneously are
P (Two heads and One tail) = Two heads and One tail /Number of desired outcomes
= ⅜ or 0.375

## Q4)  Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a)	Equal to 1
b)	Less than or equal to 4
c)	Sum is divisible by 2 and  3
ANS- for Two Dice total number of outcome -36
a)	Equal to is 0 , As minimum sum is 2 for outcome (1,1)
    Hence Probability is 0
b) Less than or equal to 4: 
   The possible combinations for sums less than or equal to 4 are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1).
   Probability = (Less than or equal to 4) / (Total Number of Outcomes) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6
c) P (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3) = N (Event (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3)) / N(Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.16 = 16.66%

## Q5)  A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
ANS- Total number of balls = (2 + 3 + 2) = 7
Let S be the sample space.
Then, n(S) = Number of drawing 2 balls out of 7
=7C2 = (2×1)(7×6) =21
Let E = drawing 2 balls, none of which is blue.
∴n(E)= Number of drawing 2 balls out of (2 + 3) balls. =5C2 = (2×1)(5×4) =10
P(E)= n(E)/n(S) = 10/21 =0.476

## Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
### Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
### CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
ANS = Expected Value = Σ (Value * Probability)
Expected Value = (1 * 0.015) + (4 * 0.20) + (3 * 0.65) + (5 * 0.005) + (6 * 0.01) + (2 * 0.120) 
                         = 0.015 + 0.80 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24
                         = 3.10

Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?
ANS: weights of patients =108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
          Expected value = Sum (X * Probability of X) = (1/9)(108)+ (1/9)(110)+ (1/9)(123)+(1/9)(134)+ (1/9)(145)+ (1/9)(167)+ (1/9)(187)+ (1/9)(199) = 145.33

## Q11)  suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
conf_94 =stats.t.interval(alpha = 0.94, df=1999, loc=200, scale=30/np.sqrt(2000))
print(np.round(conf_94,0))
print(conf_94)
For 94% confidence interval Range is [ 198.73 – 201.26] 
For 98% confidence interval range is [198.43 – 201.56] 
For 96% confidence interval range is [198.62 – 201.37]

Mean =41, Median =40.5, Variance =25.52 and Standard Deviation =5.05
#### 2)	What can we say about the student marks? 
Don’t have outliers and the data is slightly skewed towards right because mean is greater than median

The average score is around 41.0.
The middle value is 40.5, which is close to the mean.
Variance and Standard Deviation: The variance and standard deviation are high

## Q13) what is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?
ANS : When the mean and median of a dataset are equal, it indicates that the data has a symmetric distribution. The mean is at the center of the distribution. The median is also at the center of the distribution. The values on one side of the center are similar to the values on the other side.

## Q14) what is the nature of skewness when mean > median?
ANS : When the mean is greater than the median, the distribution of the data is right-skewed or positively skewed.

## Q15) what is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
ANS : When the median is greater than the mean, the distribution is said to be negatively skewed. This means that the tail of the distribution is stretched out to the left.

## Q16) what does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?
ANS : Data with positive kurtosis have more outliers than a normal distribution.

## Q17) what does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
ANS : Negative kurtosis value indicates that wider peak and thinner tails.

## Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.

Hint:  
   rcode = pt(tscore,df)  
 df = degrees of freedom

 ANS
   rcode  = pt(tscore,df)  
 df  degrees of freedom
Ans: import numpy as np
Import scipy as stats
 t_score = (x - pop mean) / (sample standard daviation / square root of sample size)
           (260-270)/90/np.sqrt(18))
  _score = -0.471
stats.t.cdf(t_score, df = 17)
